# Effective Altruism Dashboard

Project partly inspired by the [Johns Hopkins Corona Virus Dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

Precedents:
 - [EA hub map](https://eahub.org/)

Intend to have five panels:
 - Total members/donations/pledges of EA
 - Demographics of EAs
 - World map of EAs
 - Sankey diagram of EA donations: sources -> cause areas -> charities
 - Timeline of growth (membership, donations)
 
We'd also like to do a map in the style of [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles). Countries are replaced with EA orgs, and the axes are measures of growth (donations made, donations pledged, pageviews, etc). Perhaps the central map can be toggle-able between the map and this diagram.
